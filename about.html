            <div>
                <p>
                    A project made during my free time that allows users to make art by uploading images and editing them
                    through various algorithms using vanilla JS and OpenCv. The "dog" algorithm is based on a research paper (linked below)
                    and is by far the most complicated algorithm.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Please note that there are bugs that have not been fixed. If an algorithm takes more than a minute to run, check console for bugs and/or
                    restart.

            <h1>How to Use</h1>


            <div>
                <p>Start by uploading either a single frame or an entire video. Only JPGs and PNGs are accepted as well as MP4s for videos. TIP: Lower quality images (less than 1000 pixels per side) can
                    produce faster and better results.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>If uploading a video, it is recommended you run through all the settings with a single test frame first. The final video will be of type WEBM
                    and the frame rate will be dependent on how fast the algorithms run. It's recommended to convert the video to a different type and speed it up and/or edit the video
                    if desired.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>

            <p>Next, run an algorithm of choice, changing the variables to obtain different results. Recommended order is top down: </p>

                <p>
                    The most computationally and logically complex algorithm but it provides a good base for the others, which is why it comes first. This
                    algorithm is great for mimicking art styles such as pastels and graphite. It stands for Difference of Gaussians. One gaussian is calculated
                    and is subtracted from a second gaussian using different parameters.

            <h3>Object</h3>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Uses the Canny data to detect objects using a flood fill algorithm. It fills every non-edge pixel it can find until it can no longer
                    find any. This process is repeated for every pixel. The thresholds allows you to account for any impurities and discontinuities found
                    in the Canny data.

                <p>
                    kmeans reduces the whole image to a specified number of colors. It evaluates each pixel value and finds the nearest color that fits

            <h1>How it was made</h1>

            <div>

                <p>This project is done entirely in JavaScript (partially TypeScript) and OpenCV.js.</p>
            <p>The hardest part of the project was working without a framework and using OpenCV.js which notoriously lacks documentation</p>
            <p>Moreover, JavaScript Canvas stores data in flat 8 bit arrays, which is not sufficient for complex algorithms. This is where OpenCv comes in</p>
            <p>The opencv.js file is loaded locally and saved into a Web Worker. Web Workers allow an algorithm to run on a different thread and
                allows the main thread to continue running. Communication between the Web Worker and the main thread is faciliated through a script called
                "cv.js".
            </p>

            </div>


            <div>

                <p>
                    The Local Binary Pattern algorithm is implemented independently from the OpenCV library and is stored in its own file 
                </p>
    
                <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">kMeans</a> and 
                    <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector">Canny</a> algorithm are implemented using the OpenCV library. 
                    For the sake of simplicity, only some variables are editable by the user in the interface.</p> 
                <p>
                    All the other algorithms are implemented manually using OpenCV's data structures, specifically Mats (matrices) which allow pixel by pixel
                    manipulation in various depths (64F was used). Using opencv.js allows these matrices to have compatibility with Canvas.
                </p>

            <h4>
                Local Binary Pattern
            </h4>

            <div>

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_binary_patterns">LBP</a> is one of many algorithms used in image processing, specifically
                    for texture classification. In this implementation, for every pixel, the intensity of 8 neighboring pixels is compared with the center pixel.
                    if the neighbor intensity is greater than the center pixel, a 1 is stored. Otherwise, a 0 is stored. This comparison is done counter clock-wise
                    resulting in 8 bits or 1 byte. The value of the center pixel is then changed to the integer that the 8 bits represent.
                    </p>

            </div>
            

            <h4>
                Objects
            </h4>

            <div>

                <p>
                    The Objects algorithm uses the Canny data and the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill">Flood Fill algorithm</a> to detect
                    objects in the image. From every unvisited pixel, a flood fill algorithm is ran, keeping track of all "collected" pixels in the run. When the run is
                    done (aka it finds itself bound by edges defined in the Canny data), all collected pixels are associated as a single object and given a random color for visual clarity. 
                    Background and objects are determined separately and during the algorithm depending on whether the origin pixel is connected to the image's
                    4 boundaries/edges. 
    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The variables allow the user to choose how greedy the algorithm is for the background and objects run. A threshold n prevents the algorithm from visiting a pixel whose
                    distance from the two closest edges (x direction if horizontal visit is requested and y direction if vertical) is less than or equal to n. A threshold of 0 is the greediest
                    and allows the algorithm to visit any available non-edge.
    
                    <br>
                    <br>
    
                    A more accurate algorithm would involve checking diagonals instead of just x and y directions.

            <h4>Generate</h4>

            <div>

                <p>
                    The Generate algorithm combines the data from all the other algorithms except for DoG. It takes all the objects which are stored in an array 
                    and places all of its pixels by a random direction and a random amount determined by the user. A random direction is chosen for each object. Pixels
                    that were previously representing objects are filled with either black or the most common color detected in the original image. For each pixel, the LBP data
                    texture is applied with the alpha channel (RGBa). The color is applied with kMeans data.

            <h4>Difference of Gaussians (DoG)</h4>

            <div>

                <p>The <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians">difference of gaussians</a> algorithm is another algorithm used in image processing. There
                    are many uses for it but my implementation is a rough implementation of this <a href = "https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~sco590/winnemoeller-cag2012.pdf">University of 
                        Missouri research paper</a>. Various art styles
                        can be mimicked by simply altering the various variables, most notably charcoal, water paint, pencil, and comic book. The process of adding color and texture to
                        the final image can be forever improved. My algorithm is mostly focused on the basic implementation itself. The main principal is calculating two different gaussian
                        blurs using different standard deviations (std_e and (std_e * k)) and subtracting them using the (1 + t)*(First Gaussian) - (t)*(Second Gaussian) formula. An edge tangent
                        flow is calculated and then blured (std_c). The difference of gaussian is calculated by using this edge tangent flow and bluring across the edges. 
        
                        <br>
                        <br> 
        
                        A final blur (std_m) is the calculated along the edges to reduce noise. 
                        The resulting value is then set to 1 if its above e. If not, it passed through a formula (o). The lower o is, the more gradients the final image will have.
